# LITA-Class-Documentation

My first journey in becoming an analyst started with the introduction to data analysis, which laid the foundation for my future growth. 
The key tools used in the training are:

#### 1) Microsoft Excel for Data Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization
#### 2) SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
#### 3) GitHub for Portfolio Building
#### 4) Powerbi (Business Intelligence)

## INTRODUCTION TO DATA ANALYSIS

Definition and Importance

Data analysis is the process of extracting insights and meaningful information from data. It helps organizations make informed decisions, identify trends, and optimize performance.

### Reasons for Studying Data Analysis

- Improve business operations
- Identify opportunities and risks
- Develop data-driven strategies

Why Data Analysis and Company Usage?

Companies use data analysis to:

- Gain competitive advantage
- Improve customer satisfaction
- Optimize resource allocation
- Monitor performance metrics

Industries that Heavily Rely on Data Analysis

- Finance
- Healthcare
- Marketing
- E-commerce

Types of Data and Data Collection

#### Types of Data

##### STRUCTURED DATA
- Organized and formatted data
- Easily searchable and machine-readable
- Typically stored in databases, spreadsheets, or tables

Examples:

| Name | Age | Address      |
|------|-----|--------------|
| John | 30  | 123 Main St  |
| Jane | 25  | 456 Elm St   |

##### UNSTRUCTURED DATA
- Unorganized and unformatted data
- Difficult for machines to read and analyze
- Typically stored as text, images, videos, or audio files

Examples:

- Emails:
"Hi, I'd like to inquire about your product."
- Social media posts:
"I love using my new iPhone!"
- Images:
    - Photo of a sunset
- Videos:
    - Product demos
- Audio files:
    - Podcast episodes

##### SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA

- Partially organized data with some structure
- May contain tags, labels, or metadata
- Can be machine-readable with some processing

Examples:

- XML files:
`<customer><name>John Doe</name><age>30</age></customer>`
- JSON files:
`{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}`
- CSV files:
`Name,Age,Address`
`John Doe,30,123 Main St`
- Log files:
`2022-01-01 12:00:00 - User logged in`

### Key characteristics:

- Structured data: Tabular, organized, and easily searchable
- Unstructured data: Non-tabular, unorganized, and difficult to analyze
- Semi-structured data: Partially organized, with some structure and metadata

m## Ways to Collect Data

- Surveys
- Sensors
- Social media
- Customer feedback


### INTRODUCTION TO BASIC EXCEL

Excel is a spreadsheet software used for data manipulation and analysis.

#### Key Excel Functions*

##### Arithmetic Functions

1. _SUM_: Calculates the sum of cells.
Example: `=SUM(A1:A10)`
2. _AVERAGE_: Calculates the average of cells.
Example: `=AVERAGE(A1:A10)`
3. _COUNT_: Counts the number of cells with numbers.
Example: `=COUNT(A1:A10)`
4. _MAX/MIN_: Returns the maximum/minimum value.
Example: `=MAX(A1:A10)`, `=MIN(A1:A10)`


##### Lookup Functions

1. _VLOOKUP_: Looks up a value in a table and returns a corresponding value.
Example: `=VLOOKUP(A2, B:C, 2, FALSE)`
    - Used for: Retrieving data from a table based on a unique identifier.
    - 
##### Data Analysis Functions

1. _PIVOTTABLE_: Summarizes and analyzes large datasets.
Example: `=PIVOTTABLE(A1:C100)`
    - Used for: Reporting, data summarization, and analysis.
2. _GROUPBY_: Groups data by categories.
Example: `=GROUPBY(A1:C100, "Category")`
    - Used for: Data aggregation and analysis.


##### Text Functions

1. _LOWER/UPPER_: Converts text to lowercase/uppercase.
Example: `=LOWER(A1)`, `=UPPER(A1)`
2. _TRIM_: Removes spaces from text.
Example: `=TRIM(A1)`
3. _CONCATENATE_: Joins text strings.
Example: `=CONCATENATE(A1, B1)`

##### Logical Functions

1. _IF_: Tests conditions and returns a value.
Example: `=IF(A1>10, "True", "False")`
2. _IFS_: Tests multiple conditions and returns a value.
Example: `=IFS(A1, ">10", "True", "False")`

##### Data Validation Functions

1. _DATA_VALIDATION_: Restricts input data.
Example: `=DATA_VALIDATION(A1, "Integer")`
2. _VALIDATE_: Checks if data meets conditions.
Example: `=VALIDATE(A1, ">10")`


### Best Practices of Excel

1. _Organize Data_: Structure data logically.
2. _Use Formulas_: Instead of hardcoding values.
3. _Format Cells_: Consistently format cells.
4. _Document Work_: Use comments and notes.
